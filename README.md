###What's This?After teaching an introductory videogame studies class several years in a row, I (that is, Mark Sample) have decided to place my syllabus onto Github.The syllabus already exists in different reiterations on http://www.samplereality.com/gmu, but I am exploring whether using git facilitates greater sharing and collaboration.The syllabus is arranged here as modules, with each one a different file. One recommended viewing order is the following:1. course_description.md2. reading.md3. playing.md4. working.md5. grading.md6. calendar.md7. platformstudies.md8. missingchapter.md9. gamedesign.md
