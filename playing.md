###PlayingIn order to critically study videogames it is necessary of course to play them. We will experiment with games in class, and you will also be responsible for playing many games on your own outside of class. The specific titles I ask you to play may change, depending upon the direction of our class discussion.Most of the required games for the class are either playable online or downloadable and playable on personal computers, often through emulators. For example, [Stella](http://stella.sourceforge.net/) is an emulator for Macs and PCs which plays Atari 2600 games, while [Nestopia](http://nestopia.sourceforge.net/) plays Nintendo games.We will play one game this semester that requires purchasing. The title has yet to be determined but it will be available for Macs and PCs through [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) for around ten dollars.Be forewarned that several games on the syllabus contain content that may offend some sensibilities, including graphic violence, explicit language, and sexual references. If you anticipate that such material may prevent you from completing the required work, I recommend that you reconsider your enrollment in this section of HNRS 353.
