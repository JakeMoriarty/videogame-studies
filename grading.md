##GradingThe final grade will be weighted and calculated in the following manner:*    In-Class Participation: 15%*   Virtual Participation: 15%*    Class Blogging: 15%*    Platform Studies Inquiry: 15%*    HTDTWV Missing Chapter: 20%*    Game Design Project: 20%I give every assignment a letter grade, except for the blog posts, which are graded according to the scale shown above. I use the following standard grading scale:* A+ = 100%* A = 95%* A- = 90% 	* B+ = 88%* B = 85%* B- = 80% 	* C+ = 78%* C = 75%* C- = 70% 	* D = 65%* F = below 60Late assignments will be lowered one letter grade for every 24 hours they are overdue, unless prior arrangements are made. Even if you are not in class the day an assignment is due, it is still due for you that day. Assignments more than a week late for any reason will simply not be accepted. Therefore, failure to hand in every assignment on time will make it extremely difficult to pass the course.Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add this course is Tuesday, January 31. The last day to drop this course is February 24, 2012. After the last day to drop a class, withdrawal from HNRS 353 requires the approval of the dean and is only allowed for nonacademic reasons.
