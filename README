###What's This?

After teaching an introductory videogame studies class several years in a row, I've decided to place my syllabus onto Github.

The syllabus already exists in different reiterations on [samplereality.com](http://www.samplereality.com/gmu), but I exploring whether using git facilitates greater sharing and collaboration.
